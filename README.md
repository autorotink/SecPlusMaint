# Sec+ Certificate Maintenance
[CompTIA website](https://www.comptia.org/continuing-education/choose/renewing-with-multiple-activities): CompTIA gives some options for renewing certs.  For Sec+ (which is what I'm going to focus on) I only need 50 CEUs within the three-year cycle.  I figure, I can focus on capturing what I do to maintain my cert so I'll be ready when the time comes!

>**GCCC**: Count towards CEUs for my Sec+, however (see what Copilot says, which also sounds like a good summary from what I've read on the CompTIA site): 
Your CompTIA Security+ certification is valid for three years from the date you earned it, so it will expire in June 2027 unless renewed.

>> If you earn your GIAC Certified Cybersecurity Certification (GCCC) in March 2025, it can potentially count toward renewing your Security+ certification. However, the renewal will extend your Security+ certification by three years from the **date of renewal activity**, not from the original expiration date3. So, if your GCCC is accepted for renewal in March 2025, your Security+ would then be valid until March 2028.
