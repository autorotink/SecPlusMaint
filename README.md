# Sec+ Certificate Maintenance
[CompTIA website](https://www.comptia.org/continuing-education/choose/renewing-with-multiple-activities): CompTIA gives some options for renewing certs.  For Sec+ (which is what I'm going to focus on) I only need 50 CEUs within the three-year cycle.  I figure, I can focus on capturing what I do to maintain my cert so I'll be ready when the time comes!
